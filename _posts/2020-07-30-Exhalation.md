Like in the collection *Stories of Your Life*, that I reviewed earlier
this year, in the stories of *Exhalation* Ted Chiang explores the
weird consequences of odd assumptions in compelling, sometimes thrilling
stories.
These assumptions are either not yet in place but plausible in the
future, or obviously incorrect but accepted at some point in history,
or have always been implausible but fascinating nevertheless.

In "*The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling*" Ted Chiang explores how
memory assistant technology changes the way we perceive history and
experience our own memories. He does it in two interwoven stories, one
playing in the past, the other in the future. The one in the past
is told from Jijingi's perspective, a thirteen year old boy from a
village in Tivland, in today's Nigeria, at the time when Europeans had
come to the area and changed the ways how the Tiv people lived. One of
the things Europeans brought with them was writing. Jijingi learned
writing from a missionary and thus became secretary of Sabe, one of the clan
elders. One of the things Sabe had to discuss and, together with elders
of other clans to decide, was, with which other clans they should join
in order to simplify administration. A sensible decision had to be
based on where clans originated from and how they were related. The clan elders had a view of those relations based
on their own memories and on what had been related to them from their
ancestors. But when Jijingi looked up the written record of the
Europeans, it did not match quite the understanding of the clan
elders. The dispute was complicated by the fact that it was not only a
matter of factual history but also of similarity of values, life
styles, and customs.

The story of the future follows the impact of lifelogging and
Remem. Remem is a visual search algorithm that allows to find relevant
video sequences in exabytes of video streams within milliseconds. For
people who make lifelogs with their spectacle integrated cameras,
Remem smoothly gives answers to questions like, "where did I put my
keys in the morning?" or "what was the name of the Greek restaurant we
visited in our vacations ten or twelve years ago in California? Or was
it Florida?" But the more impact-full questions were when partners
quarrel about who had said what in an argument a day or a
month ago, how exactly one had offended the other, and why one had
been misunderstood by the other. Remem mercilessly uncovers that our
own memories are greatly distorted and has the potential to fully
unravel our perceptions of ourselves and others. While Remem
contributes to a more faithful understanding of our own behaviors, it
also seems to foster small-minded, petty fighting about who is right and
who is wrong. Hence, not everybody embraces its use and some find its
benefits limited and its overall effect harmful. But in the story at
hand the narrator uncovers, with Remem's help, an inconvenient truth
about his relation with his daughter. He had been estranged from his
daughter years ago and the way he remembered the reasons and mechanics
of this estrangement turned out not to be quite in line with the
facts.

In other stories Ted Chiang explores how our avatars develop when they
learn how to learn and the virtual and the real world starts to merge
("*The Lifecylce of Software Objects*"), or how science might have
developed if the Bible's claim that God created the world some 7000
years ago were found to be correct ("*Omphalos*"). "*Anxiety is the
Dizzyness of Freedom*" studies the effects a device called prism, for
"Plaga interworld signaling mechanism" might have. Given that the
multiverse theory is true and the world splits in every moment in an
uncountable number of multiverses and they quickly diverge from each
other due to small initial differences in quantum fluctuations, prism
allows to keep contact with one of the other multiverses, at least for
some time. As the prism technology develops, the amount of information
that can be exchanged between two connected multiverses grows, from a
few bits in the beginning to entire video calls after some
years. Given prisms growing capabilities, people start to wonder how
their selves developed in other multiverses, if they made similar
choices, if their para-selves were as lucky or unlucky as themselves,
or if they had met the same partner and raised the same children.




Each of these stories is a gem and delves into fascinating questions
that all have, but looked upon from a radically new and unexpected
angle.

Ted Chiang (his Chinese name is Chiang Feng-nan (姜峯楠)), born in 1967 in New York, is the son of Chinese parents
who migrated via Taiwan to the US. A Computer scientist by training he
started to write science fiction stories already as teenager and 
has  now won several awards for his lucid, sometimes magical
stories. The movie *Arrival* is based in his "*The Story of Your
Life*", which by itself is fascinating even though it deviates
significantly from Chiang's narrative.
