<h2>Good Ecomomics for Hard Times</h2>
<h3>by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo</h3>
<h3>Penguin Books, 2019 </h3>

<P>
  The book starts out with a dark joke: "A woman hears from her doctor that
  she has only half a year to live. The doctor advices her to marry an
  economist and move to South Dakota.
  <br>

  Woman: 'Will this cure my illness?'<br>

  Doctor: 'No, but the half year will seem pretty long.'"

<P> But the book is anything but boring. In fact it reads
  effortlessly, is full of interesting facts and surprising
  insights. It disccusses a range of relevant and timely issues and is
  fundamentally inspired by the desire to help people. This desire
  seems to drive the authors to find out what really works and what
  does not. And they inform us that "there are no iron laws of
  economics keeping us from building a more humane world." 
</P>

<P> With a critical attitude towards their own profession the two
  economists and authors review for a range of relevant topics what we
  today know what works and where our knowledge is incomplete or
  speculative.  In particular they repeatedly reject ideological
  answers, some of which have dominated the economic profession and
  politics for decades, and still do. 
</P>

<P> The topics of the book are migration, trade, what is a good live,
  GDP growth, climate change, the impact of technological innovations,
  inequality, government intervention and universal basic income. In
  all cases the authors look at the facts collected in studies and
  tell us, what we know today and what works. For instance, in the
  chapter on economic growth they conclude that economists today
  cannot really explain why some countries grow more and others less,
  why contries suddenly start growing faster or slow down. Apparently
  we don't really know what governemnts can do to facilitate higher
  growth. 
</P>

<P> To me this comes as a big surprise because over the years I have
  read so many great economists telling the world with unshakable
  conviction what should be done to make growth happen. And almost
  daily I hear some politician explaining, that this or that measure
  will strengthen the economy and increase growth. Now it turns out
  that, if Banerjee and Duflo are right, they are all on thin ice and
  have neither theory nor evidence to count on. One wonders where the
  strong conviction comes from. 
</P>

<P> But although the authors are sceptical towards policies not
  grounded in understanding and evicende, they are even more sceptical
  in leaving things to the market. In fact, a "recurring theme of the
  book is, that it is unreasonable to expect markets to always deliver
  outcomes that are just, acceptable or even efficient" (p 263) 
</P>

<P> Hence, throughout the book the authors warn us to be wary of
  ideological cliches and tell us never to trust explanations without
  strong evidence. But they also provide many and sometimes exciting
  examples of measures that actually do work. For instance are they
  full of praise of the Scandinavian approach to protect workers but
  not jobs and to help and support people in times of crises inflicted
  on them by global or local forces beyond their control. With great
  sympathy I read their plead for preserving the dignity of people
  when they live in poverty, have suffered  and find few means to
  improve their lot. Inspiring hope and self-confidence seems often
  more important than material aid. 
</P>

<P> All in all it is a wonderful book that will be enjoyed by everyone
  who is interested in the big questions of our time and doesn't
  expect their previous convictions to be confirmed.
