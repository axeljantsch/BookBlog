<h2>Stories of Your Life, by Ted Chiang</h2>
<h3>by Ted Chiang</h3>
<h3>Vintage Books, 2016</h3>


<P> Ted Chiang writes science fiction stories, sort of. They are
  fiction in the sense that they have not and could not happen in the
  way narrated, and science in the sense that often they assume
  technology advances, which are hard to comprehend.</P>

<P> The salient feature of all stories in the book is that assumptions
  are made which are obviously incompatible with our scientific
  knowledge, but once accepted, the stories develop highly convincing,
  logical and full of compelling details. For instance, in Seventy-Two
  Letters the assumption is, that new human babies are created from
  small copies of humans in the male sperm, each of them have again
  smaller copies of humans in their sperm, in a possibly infintie
  regression. This was in fact a common and plausible theoory in
  science before the like of Darwin, Watson, Franklin and Crick solved
  the puzzle of natural reproduction. So although we know today, that
  this is not the way biology works, once you accept this assumption,
  the story develops highly logical and thrilling.</P> 


<P> Other odd assumptions as starting point of fascinating stories in
  this book are that archangles frequently visit the earth and inflict
  miracles of sorts, that there exisits a drug that blocks the brain
  from seeing the beauty, and ugliness, in faces without missing any
  factual details, and that the future can in some way be known but
  not changed. </P> 

<P> Starting from weird assumptions the stories are perfect in the
  sense that they are full of convincing details, narrated in an
  engaging vivid style and developed to their utmost logical
  consequences. If you enjoy when your imagination is guided over very
  thin ice to impossible, yet in themselves consistent cities full of
  color and detail, you will read these stories by Ted Chiang with
  pleasure.</P>
